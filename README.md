Covid ID is a project out of iLab associated with Computer Science at California State University East Bay to explore how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to assist the general public with situation awareness as it relates to Covid-19.   Initially a multi-faceted approach will be taken that explores different detection modules that would assist a user with understanding potential risks related to geographical locations.
